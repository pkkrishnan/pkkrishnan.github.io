          <p>Application of supervised machine learning models to predict the size of a wildfire (continuous variable) and a probability of a wildfire (classification). 
The project scope included: A literature review to understand the performance of external models and develop domain knowledge, leveraging several techniques of ML in the project (Spatial join, PCA, Time series modeling, DNN, Sub-group analysis, and Automated Hyper Parameter Optimization), built baseline shallow models (Linear Regression) to assess baseline metrics, tuned DNN model, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boost Regression to improve performance over baseline and external benchmarks.
