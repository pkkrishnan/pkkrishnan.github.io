          <h3><a href="https://github.com/pkkrishnan/CA_Wild_Fires">Machine Learning: Predicting California Wildfires</a></h3>
          <p>Application of supervised machine learning models to predict the size of a wildfire (continuous variable) and a probability of a wildfire (classification). 
The project scope included: A literature review to understand the performance of external models and develop domain knowledge, leveraging several techniques of ML in the project (Spatial join, PCA, Time series modeling, DNN, Sub-group analysis, and Automated Hyper Parameter Optimization), built baseline shallow models (Linear Regression) to assess baseline metrics, tuned DNN model, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boost Regression to improve performance over baseline and external benchmarks. 
Packages Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras/Tensor Flow, Pandas, GeoPandas, Altair, Matplotlib
Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, SHAP Analysis, PCA, Deep Neural Networks using Keras Sequential Models

          <p>Investing in rapid transit systems is very popular across the globe and such systems oftentimes drive economic value by driving urban growth. Rapid transit systems include subways, metros, and light rails. 
In this project, the application of statistical design, model building, and evaluation are leveraged, to identify the key contributing features that impact the cost of a rapid transit project. Leveraging R, data exploration, data analysis, regression models, OLS assumption evaluation, and model selection were performed.
Packages Used: R
